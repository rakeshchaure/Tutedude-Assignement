Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 


Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.
 
Expected Output:
For example, if the function is called with 5, it should return:
'''
def factorial(num):
    if num==1:
        return 1
    else:
        fact=num*factorial(num-1)
        return fact
n=int(input("Enter a number:"))
print(f'factorial of {n} is:{factorial(n)}')
